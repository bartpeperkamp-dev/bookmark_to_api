# Bookmark to API

## What it does

Displays a simple button in the menu bar that sends the tabs url to a API endpoint of your choosing.

To display the button, the extension registers a [browserAction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserAction) in the manifest.

A background script will listen for tab events and update the browserAction icon correspondingly. It also listens for `browserAction.onClicked` events to create or remove a bookmark when the user has clicked the icon.
